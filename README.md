# Experiment-1
Aim

To understand and demonstrate the use of fundamental data types in C++ including integer, floating-point, double precision floating-point, character, and boolean types, and to display their values using basic input-output statements.

Theory

In C++, data types define the kind of data that variables can hold. The most common built-in data types include:

int: Used to store whole numbers without fractional parts. Typically occupies 4 bytes and represents both positive and negative integers.

float: A single precision floating-point type used for decimal numbers, typically occupying 4 bytes. It provides moderate precision suitable for many scientific calculations.

double: A double precision floating-point type, generally using 8 bytes, offering higher precision and a wider range than float.

char: Used to store single characters such as letters, digits, or symbols. It typically occupies 1 byte and stores ASCII values.

bool: Represents boolean values true or false, typically occupying 1 byte. It is widely used for logical operations and decision-making.

Displaying values of these types demonstrates how C++ manages different data representations in memory and how they can be outputted to the console using the cout statement. This program also highlights the use of the ternary operator for conditional output, showcasing the expressive power of C++ syntax.

Algorithm

I. Start the program. II. Declare and initialize an integer variable age with a value, e.g., 20. III. Declare and initialize a floating-point variable pi with a value, e.g., 3.14. IV. Declare and initialize a double precision floating-point variable distance with a value, e.g., 12345.678. V. Declare and initialize a character variable grade with a value, e.g., 'A'. VI. Declare and initialize a boolean variable passed with a value true. VII. Use the output stream (cout) to display the value of each variable with appropriate labels. VIII. For the boolean variable, use a conditional expression to print "Yes" if true, and "No" if false. IX. End the program.

Conclusion

This program provides a clear and simple demonstration of basic data types in C++, essential for beginners to grasp how different types of data are stored and manipulated. Understanding these fundamental types is critical because they form the building blocks for all programming tasks, from simple calculations to complex data structures.

By initializing variables of various types and displaying their values, the program illustrates the syntax and semantics involved in declaring and using variables in C++. It also demonstrates how C++ handles boolean values during output, which is particularly useful for decision-making and control flow.

The practical use of cout for output helps users understand how data is presented to users or other systems, and the use of different types underscores the importance of choosing the correct data type to optimize memory usage and precision.

Overall, this foundational knowledge prepares programmers to tackle more advanced concepts such as type casting, user input handling, arithmetic operations, and logical expressions. Mastery of data types is essential for writing efficient, readable, and bug-free C++ programs.
